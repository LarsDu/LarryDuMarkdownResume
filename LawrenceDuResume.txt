Experience

Freenome • Senior Machine Learning Research Engineer

08/2022 - 06/2024 (South San Francisco, CA)

-   Led greenfield project building end-to-end scalable distributed
    machine learning platform using PyTorch, Ray, and Kubernetes for
    cancer detection from deep sequencing (methylated DNA) and protein
    data, enabling training of much larger models leveraging data
    distributed parallel (DDP) processing speeding up model training
    by >10x.
-   Deployed and managed an organization-wide MLFlow based model
    tracking system using Terraform, Pulumi, and Google Cloud enabling
    live-monitoring of deep learning model training progress,
    instantaneous results sharing, and completely automated and
    reproducible report generation - reducing researcher manual effort
    by at least 5x.
-   Built scalable multitask learning, elastic net, and neural network
    based models in PyTorch with improved performance for classifying
    Colorectal Cancer risk from cell-free DNA data for a clinical trial
    cohort of >27,000 individuals.
-   Piloted a project to summarize biomedical literature using LLMs,
    first using GPT-4 and later by fine-tuning an open source LLM via
    DPO (direct preference optimization), demonstrating the viability of
    using LLMs to parse unstructured biomedical records for scaling up
    feature extraction.

23andMe • Machine Learning Engineer • Data Scientist (prior to 2020)

11/2018 - 08/2022 (Sunnyvale, CA)

-   Created and deployed into production Recent Ancestor Locations
    (RAL) - a high precision, high recall country matching algorithm
    which serves >15 million customers worldwide.
-   Improved graph-based techniques for unsupervised identification of
    populations by genetically based identity-by-descent (IBD) family
    relationship, demonstrating an effective way to segment
    sub-populations (graph community detection) in Mexico and the United
    Kingdom in an semi-unsupervised manner.
-   Built a large-scale feature engineering ETL pipeline for imputed
    SNPs (~10 million samples x ~1 million SNPs) using AWS Batch,
    Metaflow, AWS Glue, and AWS Athena enabling creation of higher
    quality GWAS and Polygenic Risk Score (PRS) ML models.
-   Developed improved models for type 2 diabetes and Coronary Artery
    Disease by building and evaluating model stacking ensembles into
    production PRS pipelines, improving the sensitivity and specificity
    of 23andMe tests for tens of thousands of customers.
-   Automated performance metric report generation for all polygenic
    risk score classifiers leveraging MLFlow artifact storage and
    headless Jupyter execution, reducing researcher time spent on
    analysis from days to minutes.

Scripps Research • Bioinformatician IV

05/2018 - 10/2018 (San Diego, CA)

-   Developed a classifier for organ transplant rejection using RNA data
    and wrote pipelines for Nanopore long-read sequencers using Common
    Workflow Language.

Juno Diagnostics • Independent Consultant

09/2017 - 02/2018 (San Diego, CA)

-   Developed patent -- US20210020314A1 - Deep learning-based methods,
    devices, and systems for prenatal testing along with a Tensorflow
    based classifier for detecting prenatal genetic abnormalities from
    high throughput sequencing data.

Insight • Data Science Fellow

01/2017 - 04/2017 (Remote)

-   Built and deployed (as a Flask app on AWS EC2) DeepPixelMonster - a
    Tensorflow based GAN for creating pixel art, back when GANs were
    still relatively state-of-the art.

UC San Diego • PhD Student Biology • Scott A. Rifkin Lab

08/2010 - 05/2017 (La Jolla, CA)

-   Wrote DeepNuc - a CNN model for classifying over 500,000
    transcriptional start site (TSS) flanking sequences from humans,
    mice, fruit flies, and nematodes as well as for over 60,000 microRNA
    target sequences.
-   Researched the role of RNA expression noise during animal
    development by imaging single molecule RNA expression data in >5,000
    embryos and analyzing data using self-written MATLAB tools for image
    segmentation, fluorescence quantification, and image deconvolution.
