Experience

Software Engineer - Machine Learning Engineering • 23andMe

Apr 2020 - Present (Sunnyvale, CA)

-   Improved polygenic risk score models through model ensembling.
-   Engineered a large-scale pipeline for calculating quality metrics of
    imputed single-nucleotide polymorphisms (~10 trillion datapoints)
    across an distributed cloud cluster (using AWS Batch, Metaflow, AWS
    Glue, and AWS Athena) to create a fully productionized feature
    engineering database for improving polygenic risk score models.

Data Scientist - Ancestry Product • 23andMe

Nov 2018 - Apr 2020 (Sunnyvale, CA)

-   Developed current version of Recent Ancestor Locations (RAL) - a
    machine-learning based country matching algorithm which serves >10
    million customers worldwide.
-   Built Recent Ancestor Locations to run as a microservice on AWS
    backed hardware using MLflow for model artifact tracking.
-   Improved graph-based techniques for unsupervised identification of
    populations by genetic relationships.

Bioinformatician IV • Scripps Research

May 2018 - Oct 2018 (San Diego, CA)

-   Wrote robust automated sequencing pipelines for Oxford Nanopore data
    using Common Workflow Language (CWL) for realtime microbial
    diagnostics, de novo genome assembly, and variant calling.

Independent Consultant • Juno Diagnostics (startup - $25 million Series A closed in May 2021)

Sept 2017 - Feb 2018 (San Diego, CA)

-   Developed patent -- EP3773534A1 - Deep learning-based methods,
    devices, and systems for prenatal testing along with a Tensorflow
    based deep learning software package for detecting prenatal genetic
    abnormalities.
-   Created a genetic abnormality simulator derived from statistical
    analysis of human high throughput sequencing data.

Data Science Fellow • Insight

Jan 2017 - Apr 2017 (Remote Session - San Diego, CA)

-   Wrote DeepPixelMonster and created an interactive Python Flask web
    application hosted on Amazon AWS integrated with a Tensorflow
    back-end for GAN based art generation.

PhD Student Biology • UC San Diego • Scott A. Rifkin Lab

Aug 2010 - May 2017 (La Jolla, CA)

-   Performed research on RNA expression noise during animal development
    by imaging single molecule RNA expression data >5,000 embryos and
    analyzing data using self-written MATLAB tools for image
    segmentation, fluorescence quantification, and image deconvolution.
-   Wrote DeepNuc - a CNN model for classifying over 500,000
    transcriptional start site (TSS) flanking sequences from humans,
    mice, fruit flies, and nematodes and over 60,000 microRNA target
    sequences (from publically available CLEAR-CLIP data).
-   Transgenically modified over 70 nematode and Drosophila strains
    using techniques such as GIBSON assembly, CRISPR/Cas9, MosSCI, and
    PhiC31 integrase.
