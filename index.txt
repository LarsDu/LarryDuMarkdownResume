Experience

_Senior Machine Learning Platform Engineer_ • Freenome

Aug 2022 - Present (San Francisco, CA)

-   Developed cloud based research tooling for classifying cancer
    disease risk using Kubernetes, Terraform, Docker, and Google Cloud.

_Software Engineer - Machine Learning Engineering • 23andMe_

Apr 2020 - Aug 2022 (Sunnyvale, CA)

-   Built a large-scale feature engineering ETL pipeline for imputed
    SNPs (~10 million samples x ~1 million SNPs) using AWS Batch,
    Metaflow, AWS Glue, and AWS Athena used to feed downstream GWAS and
    Polygenic Risk Score (PRS) ML models.
-   Improved PRS model AUCs and auPRCs through model stacking.

_Data Scientist - Ancestry Product • 23andMe_

Nov 2018 - Apr 2020 (Sunnyvale, CA)

-   Developed Recent Ancestor Locations (RAL) - a high precision, high
    recall country matching algorithm which serves >10 million customers
    worldwide.
-   Deployed RAL using MLflow and AWS Fargate
-   Improved graph-based techniques for unsupervised identification of
    populations by identity-by-descent (IBD) relationships.

_Bioinformatician IV • Scripps Research_

May 2018 - Oct 2018 (San Diego, CA)

-   Developed a classifier for organ transplant rejection using RNA
    data.
-   Wrote pipelines for Nanopore long-read sequencers using CWL.

_Independent Consultant • Juno Diagnostics_

Sept 2017 - Feb 2018 (San Diego, CA)

-   Developed patent -- US20210020314A1 - Deep learning-based methods,
    devices, and systems for prenatal testing along with a Tensorflow
    based classifier for detecting prenatal genetic abnormalities from
    high throughput sequencing data.

_Data Science Fellow • Insight_

Jan 2017 - Apr 2017 (Remote Session - San Diego, CA)

-   Wrote DeepPixelMonster - a Deep Convolutional Generative Adverserial
    Network (DCGAN) for creating pixel art (deployed as Flask App on AWS
    EC2).

_PhD Student Biology • UC San Diego • Scott A. Rifkin Lab_

Aug 2010 - May 2017 (La Jolla, CA)

-   Wrote DeepNuc - a CNN model for classifying over 500,000
    transcriptional start site (TSS) flanking sequences from humans,
    mice, fruit flies, and nematodes as well as for over 60,000 microRNA
    target sequences.
-   Researched the role of RNA expression noise during animal
    development by imaging single molecule RNA expression data in >5,000
    embryos and analyzing data using self-written MATLAB tools for image
    segmentation, fluorescence quantification, and image deconvolution.
