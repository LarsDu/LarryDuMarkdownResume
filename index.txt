Experience

_Software Engineer II - Machine Learning Engineering • 23andMe_

Apr 2020 - Present (Sunnyvale, CA)

-   Major contributor to a new AWS Athena backed service used by
    researchers for pulling imputed single nucleotide polymorphism
    metadata used by machine learning models and GWAS pipelines.
-   Created automated model validation pipelines for supporting new
    deployments of country-matching algorithm _see below_ (using Jenkins
    and MLflow).

_Data Scientist - Ancestry Product • 23andMe_

Nov 2018 - Apr 2020 (Sunnyvale, CA)

-   Developed (and now maintain) current version of machine-learning
    based country matching algorithm which reaches >10 million customers
    worldwide.
-   Adapted new Recent Ancestor Locations to run as a microservice on
    AWS backed hardware using MLflow for model artifact tracking.
-   Improved graph-based techniques for unsupervised identification of
    populations by genetic relationships.

_Bioinformatician IV • Scripps Research_

May 2018 - Oct 2018 (San Diego, CA)

-   Wrote robust automated sequencing pipelines for Oxford Nanopore data
    using Common Workflow Language (CWL) for realtime microbial
    diagnostics, _de novo_ genome assembly, and variant calling.

_Independent Consultant • Juno Diagnostics/Mindwerks (startup)_

Sept 2017 - Feb 2018 (San Diego, CA)

-   Developed novel IP utilizing Tensorflow deep neural networks for
    identifying genetic abnormalities from sequencing of cell-free DNA.
-   Created a genetic abnormality simulator derived from statistical
    analysis of human high throughput sequencing data.
-   Authored patent description concerning deep learning applications
    for diagnosis of genetic conditions.

_Data Science Fellow • Insight_

Jan 2017 - Apr 2017 (Remote Session - San Diego, CA)

-   Wrote DeepPixelMonster and created an interactive Python Flask web
    application hosted on Amazon AWS integrated with a Tensorflow
    back-end for GAN based art generation.

_PhD Student Biology • UC San Diego • Scott A. Rifkin Lab_

Aug 2010 - May 2017 (La Jolla, CA)

-   Performed research on RNA expression noise during animal development
    by imaging single molecule RNA expression data >5,000 embryos and
    analyzing data using self-written MATLAB tools for image
    segmentation, fluorescence quantification, and image deconvolution.
-   Wrote DeepNuc - a CNN model for classifying over 500,000
    transcriptional start site (TSS) flanking sequences from humans,
    mice, fruit flies, and nematodes and over 60,000 microRNA target
    sequences (from publically available CLEAR-CLIP data).
-   Transgenically modified over 70 nematode and Drosophila strains
    using techniques such as GIBSON assembly, CRISPR/Cas9, MosSCI, and
    _PhiC31_ integrase.
