Experience
--------------------

#### *Senior Machine Learning Platform Engineer* • [Freenome](https://www.linkedin.com/company/freenome/mycompany/)
##### Aug 2022 - Jun 2024 (South San Francisco, CA)

 * Led greenfield project building end-to-end scalable distributed machine learning platform using PyTorch, Ray, and Kubernetes for cancer detection from deep sequencing (methylated DNA) and protein data.
 * Built scalable multitask learning, elastic net, and neural network based models with improved performance for classifying Colorectal Cancer risk from cell-free DNA data.
 * Piloted a project to summarize biomedical literature using an LLM, first using GPT-4 and then via fine-tuning an open source LLM using DPO (direct policty optimization).
 * Deployed and managed an organization-wide MLFlow based model tracking system for reproducibility, monitoring, and automated model performance reporting using Terraform, Pulumi, and Google Cloud.

#### *Software Engineer - Machine Learning Engineering • Data Scientist (prior to 2020) - Ancestry Product [23andMe](https://www.linkedin.com/company/23andme/mycompany/)*
##### Nov 2018 - Aug 2022 (Sunnyvale, CA)

 * Built a large-scale feature engineering ETL pipeline for imputed SNPs (~10 million samples x ~1 million SNPs) using AWS Batch, Metaflow, AWS Glue, and AWS Athena used to feed downstream GWAS and Polygenic Risk Score (PRS) ML models.
 * Improved PRS model AUCs and auPRC performance metrics through model stacking approaches.
 * Developed and deployed (using MLFlow + AWS Fargate) Recent Ancestor Locations (RAL) - a high precision, high recall country matching algorithm which serves >15 million customers worldwide.
 * Improved graph-based techniques for unsupervised identification of populations by genetically based identity-by-descent (IBD) family relationships.

#### *Bioinformatician IV • [Scripps Research](https://www.scripps.edu/science-and-medicine/cores-and-services/bioinformatics-core/index.html)*
##### May 2018 - Oct 2018 (San Diego, CA)

 * Developed a classifier for organ transplant rejection using RNA data and wrote pipelines for Nanopore long-read sequencers using Common Workflow Language.

#### *Independent Consultant • [Juno Diagnostics](https://www.linkedin.com/company/juno-diagnostics/)*
##### Sept 2017 - Feb 2018 (San Diego, CA)

 * Developed patent -- [US20210020314A1 - Deep learning-based methods, devices, and systems for prenatal testing](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20210020314A1) along with a Tensorflow based classifier for detecting prenatal genetic abnormalities from high throughput sequencing data.

#### *Data Science Fellow • [Insight](https://insightfellows.com/data-science)*
##### Jan 2017 - Apr 2017 (Remote Session - San Diego, CA)

 * Built and deployed (as a Flask app on AWS EC2) [DeepPixelMonster](https://github.com/LarsDu/DeepPixelMonster) - a Tensorflow based GAN for creating pixel art, back when GANs were still relatively state-of-the art.

#### *PhD Student Biology • UC San Diego • [Scott A. Rifkin Lab](http://labs.biology.ucsd.edu/rifkin/)*
##### Aug 2010 - May 2017 (La Jolla, CA)

 * Wrote [DeepNuc](https://github.com/LarsDu/DeepNuc) - a CNN model for classifying over 500,000 transcriptional start site (TSS) flanking sequences from humans, mice, fruit flies, and nematodes as well as for over 60,000 microRNA target sequences.
 * Researched the role of RNA expression noise during animal development by imaging single molecule RNA expression data in >5,000 embryos and analyzing data using self-written MATLAB tools for image segmentation, fluorescence quantification, and image deconvolution.
