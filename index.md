Experience
--------------------

### * Senior Machine Learning Platform Engineer* • [Freenome](https://www.linkedin.com/company/freenome/mycompany/)
###### Aug 2022 - Present (San Francisco, CA)

 * Developed cloud based research tooling for classifying cancer disease risk using Kubernetes, Terraform, Docker, and Google Cloud.

### *Software Engineer - Machine Learning Engineering • [23andMe](https://www.linkedin.com/company/23andme/mycompany/)*
###### Apr 2020 - Aug 2022 (Sunnyvale, CA)

 * Built a large-scale feature engineering ETL pipeline for imputed SNPs (~10 million samples x ~1 million SNPs) using AWS Batch, Metaflow, AWS Glue, and AWS Athena used to feed downstream GWAS and Polygenic Risk Score (PRS) ML models.
 * Improved PRS model AUCs and auPRCs through model stacking.

#### *Data Scientist - Ancestry Product • [23andMe](https://www.linkedin.com/company/23andme/mycompany/)*
###### Nov 2018 - Apr 2020 (Sunnyvale, CA)

 * Developed Recent Ancestor Locations (RAL) - a high precision, high recall country matching algorithm which serves >10 million customers worldwide.
 * Deployed RAL using MLflow and AWS Fargate
 * Improved graph-based techniques for unsupervised identification of populations by identity-by-descent (IBD) relationships.

#### *Bioinformatician IV • [Scripps Research](https://www.scripps.edu/science-and-medicine/cores-and-services/bioinformatics-core/index.html)*
###### May 2018 - Oct 2018 (San Diego, CA)

 * Developed a classifier for organ transplant rejection using RNA data.
 * Wrote pipelines for Nanopore long-read sequencers using CWL.
  

#### *Independent Consultant • [Juno Diagnostics](https://www.linkedin.com/company/juno-diagnostics/)*
##### Sept 2017 - Feb 2018 (San Diego, CA)

 * Developed patent -- [US20210020314A1 - Deep learning-based methods, devices, and systems for prenatal testing](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20210020314A1) along with a Tensorflow based classifier for detecting prenatal genetic abnormalities from high throughput sequencing data.

#### *Data Science Fellow • [Insight](https://insightfellows.com/data-science)*
###### Jan 2017 - Apr 2017 (Remote Session - San Diego, CA)

 * Wrote [DeepPixelMonster](https://github.com/LarsDu/DeepPixelMonster) - a Deep Convolutional Generative Adverserial Network (DCGAN) for creating pixel art (deployed as Flask App on AWS EC2). 

#### *PhD Student Biology • UC San Diego • [Scott A. Rifkin Lab](http://labs.biology.ucsd.edu/rifkin/)*
###### Aug 2010 - May 2017 (La Jolla, CA)

 * Wrote [DeepNuc](https://github.com/LarsDu/DeepNuc) - a CNN model for classifying over 500,000 transcriptional start site (TSS) flanking sequences from humans, mice, fruit flies, and nematodes as well as for over 60,000 microRNA target sequences.
 * Researched the role of RNA expression noise during animal development by imaging single molecule RNA expression data in >5,000 embryos and analyzing data using self-written MATLAB tools for image segmentation, fluorescence quantification, and image deconvolution.
